# Honors College Resources
## What's New
* Thu 8/19, late -- hey I found a new **[Honors College Handbook](https://uofi.app.box.com/v/handbook-2020-2021)!!**
  * pro: it's better written than the other two
  * con: how many different dang versions of the requirements can they write?!?

## HONORS COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS

1. [Honors College Handbook](https://uofi.app.box.com/v/handbook-2020-2021)
  * All HC students are _required_ to read this entire PDF and to understand it.
  * scroll down to CURRICULUM (page 15) for clear requirements
  * (note: you may be prompted to install some bullsh.t "Box" app. If so, let me know and I will help.)
2. [Honors College Requirements](https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/colleges-depts/honors-college/) 
3. _(some random email... ask mom)_

Note: HON requirements vary slightly across all three of the above resources. Enjoy! ðŸ¤®
